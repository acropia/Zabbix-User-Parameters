=Zabbix User Parameters

The monitoring application Zabbix Agent is extensible by adding UserParameters to the agent configuration file. Everything that is reachable and can be output by a script, can be used as an Item in Zabbix.

The scripts I provide are ready to use stand-alone Powershell or Bash scripts. I intend to write usage documentation per stand-alone script.

For more information on the installation, configuration and usage of the scripts, look down in the subdirectories in this repo.
